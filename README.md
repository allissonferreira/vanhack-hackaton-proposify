# Vanhack Hackathon - Allisson Ferreira (Proposify)

## About
After doing some research, I discovered that one of the problems that users complain about Proposify, is the capability of multiple users editing the document at the same time. After discovering that, I decided to create this project as an example of what else could be done to try to improve Proposify's product. 

## The project
This project was made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript in the front-end. It also uses a javascript plugin (realtime-editor) along with socket.io and node.js in the back-end.

## Run the project

Clone this repository and execute:
`npm install`

Then, to start the server:
`node start`

Now just go to http://localhost:2000 and se the project :)

Thanks!
